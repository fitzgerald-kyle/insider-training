    "## Investment Strategy Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Our neural network is performing better than the XGBoost model at the moment, so we'll demo with just the NN.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a novice when it comes to developing trading strategies, and I'm not afraid to admit it. Luckily, our model is here to save us. If we use its predictions to inform the simplest of trading strategies, and that strategy competes with the SPY fund, then we'll know that our model is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here's a *really* simple strategy:\n",
    "- Knowing that our algorithm is conservative, we'll only put faith in high predictions: If an insider trade is filed for a ticker that our algorithm predicts will increase by >15% in valuation, purchase \\\\$1 at the next day's opening.\n",
    "- If, in the next 90 days, the value of our purchase is at least 15% higher at any market closing, immediately sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy, of course, assumes that we successfully make each purchase right at the opening and each sell right at the closing."

    "From 2021-08-27 to 2021-11-27, the SPY ETF fund rose from \\\\$450.19 to \\\\$456.94, a 1.5% gain.\n",

    "A major caveat is that our cross-validation is being performed during a time when the market was at an all-time peak. The market suffered a bit in early September 2021, but otherwise, mid-2021 had some of the most profitable months in recent memory, at least in terms of the S&P500.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we could get away with assuming that our algorithm's estimates would indeed be conservative.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to test our algorithm is to see if it still generates a profit during a bearish market period. For example, let's gather data from 2022-03-29 to 2022-06-29, over which period the value of SPY tumbled by ***17.38%***. We'll tone back our confidence in the algorithm a bit, knowing that we're in a bearish market period, so we'll keep our buy threshold at 15% but lower our sell threshold to 5%, just hoping to make *some* profit."

    "### Here a few thoughts I have for model improvement...\n",
    "- **We need more data!** Perhaps 23,000 training examples isn't enough.\n",
    "- **Should we ONLY train on purchases?** Common wisdom says that investors may sell for any of a number of reasons, but they only buy for one reason. All of the sale data (particularly sales occurring during the bullish market period) may have disguised the importance of sales.\n",
    "- **We need to be aware of current market trends.** The stock market is dynamic. Insider trades might signal different outcomes depending on how the economy is doing as a whole. This should inform our choice of training set.\n",
    "- **For a neural model:** Perhaps categorization is the move, instead of regression. We could also have more outputs. We can use the Keras Functional API to have different activations in the final layer, such as\n",
    "    - a softmax output that places the expected X-day price increase into a *category*, and\n",
    "    - a sigmoid output predicting *where* in the X-day window the max price will occur\n",
    "- **For XGBoost:** Again, we might be better-served by predicting price categories (e.g. 0-5%, 5-10%, etc.) instead of actual price increase. This may help remove some of the extreme noise. (For example, a 20% run and a 40% run are both great things to identify, but our model would think it performed poorly if it respectively predicted 40% and 20%!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we should keep in mind that individuals vary *a lot*. Some insiders do routine buys/sells and don't try to be opportunistic, while others are the opposite. If we really wanted to go deep with our analysis, we might want to work with an LSTM framework that remembers particular insiders' decisions and their effectiveness."
