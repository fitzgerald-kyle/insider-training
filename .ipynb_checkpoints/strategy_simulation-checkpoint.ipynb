    "## XGBoost Investment Strategy Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a total noob in this area, and I'm not afraid to admit it! Luckily, designing a foolproof investment strategy wasn't the point of this project. The point was to see if we've learned to identify which insider trades are worth paying attention to!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### However, to clearly demonstrate what has been learned, let's define a REALLY simple strategy:\n",
    "- Knowing that our algorithm is conservative, we'll only put faith in high predictions: If an insider trade is filed that our algorithm predicts will rise by >10\\%, purchase \\\\$1 at the next day's opening.\n",
    "- If, in the next 90 days, the value of our purchase is at least 15\\% higher at any closing, immediately sell. (Our algorithm is conservative enough that we've decided to be greedy, hoping to squeeze out a bit more gain than predicted.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy, of course, assumes that we successfully make each purchase right at the opening and each sell right at the closing."
