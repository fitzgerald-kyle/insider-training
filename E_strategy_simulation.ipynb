    "\n",
    "I'm a total novice in this area, and I'm not afraid to admit it! Luckily, designing a foolproof investment strategy wasn't the point of this project. The point was to see if we've learned to identify which insider trades are worth paying attention to!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### However, to clearly demonstrate what has been learned, let's define a REALLY simple strategy:\n",
    "- Knowing that our algorithm is conservative, we'll only put faith in high predictions: If an insider trade is filed that our algorithm predicts will rise by >10\\%, purchase \\\\$1 at the next day's opening.\n",
    "- If, in the next 90 days, the value of our purchase is at least 15% higher at any closing, immediately sell. (Our algorithm is conservative enough that we've decided to be greedy, hoping to squeeze out a bit more gain than predicted.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy, of course, assumes that we successfully make each purchase right at the opening and each sell right at the closing."

    "- **We need more data!** 5000 training examples probably isn't enough.\n",
    "- **Purchases are underrepresented.** Common wisdom says that investors may sell for any of a number of reasons, but they only buy for one reason. The data set has a lopsided majority of trades that are sales, which may cause our algorithms to miss out on important information to be gained from purchases.\n",
    "- **We need to be aware of current market trends.** The stock market is dynamic. Insider trades might signal different outcomes depending on how the economy is doing as a whole. This should inform our choice of training set.\n",
    "- **For a neural model:** We need to have more outputs! We could use the Keras Functional API to have different activations in the final layer, such as\n",
    "    - a softmax output categorizing the max price increase in the next X days,\n",
    "    - a linear output predicting the actual max price increase in the next X days,\n",
    "    - a sigmoid output predicting *where* in the X-day window the max price will occur\n",
    "- **For XGBoost:** We might be better-served by predicting price categories (e.g. 0-5%, 5-10%, etc.) instead of actual price increase. This may help remove some of the extreme noise. (For example, a 20% run and a 40% run are both great things to identify, but our model would think it performed poorly if it respectively predicted 40% and 20%!)"
